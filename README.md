# Next.js 15 Environment Variable Loading Issue

This repository demonstrates a strange issue encountered in Next.js 15 where environment variables fail to load correctly in one specific page, while working as expected in other parts of the application.  The problem doesn't appear to be related to the standard configuration approaches, making it quite uncommon.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (if not already present) and set a variable, for example `MY_VARIABLE=myvalue`.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
5. Navigate to `/` -  the environment variables will work here.
6. Navigate to `/about` - the environment variable will be undefined, causing an error. 

## Expected Behavior

Environment variables should be accessible in all pages of the Next.js application.

## Actual Behavior

Environment variables are accessible in some pages but not in others, without any clear reason or error message. 

## Solution

The solution involves checking the Next.js configuration for any potential inconsistencies that might be hindering the loading of environment variables in the specific page.
